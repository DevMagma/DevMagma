## Heyo! 🥰
I'm Magmabits, Magma for short. I am a chemistry enthusiast with a passion for web-development. I mainly use Javascript for regular projects and Next.js for Websites.

I'm a student living in Austria. Also, pretty much all of my projects are private so 😐.


I used to develop Discord Bots using [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js), but since school has been getting tough (and DJS began to suck even more than it did before), I decided to focus on web-development. I soon want to switch from using Next.js to using [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com).
